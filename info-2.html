		<p>Citizen Reporter is one of the latest concepts in journalism, whereby common people can voice their opinion on issues confronting them. The ordinary citizens or amateurs are the audience or readers, who too want to share their stories and concerns in the society.</p>
		
		<p>The latest technologies have lent a new life to the movement of citizen reporters globally. With the advent of cellular phones, digital cameras, Internet and blogging, many people nowadays are contributing their bit to journalism by capturing news and circulating it globally and are thus termed as citizen reporters.</p>

		<p>Citizen journalism is also known as public or participatory journalism or democratic journalism. It is the act of non-professionals, playing an active role in the process of collecting, reporting, analyzing and disseminating news and information. The intent of this participation is to provide independent, reliable, accurate, wide-ranging and relevant information that a democracy requires.</p>
